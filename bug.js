In React 19, using the new concurrent features, a seemingly innocuous change to a component's rendering logic might lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if you're using `useTransition` and you prematurely end a transition within a `startTransition` callback, the component might not fully update. This is different from React 18 where the transition would continue. The reason is that React 19 is more aggressive in its concurrent mode.
