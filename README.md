# React 19 Concurrent Mode Transition Bug

This repository demonstrates an unusual issue encountered in React 19's concurrent rendering mode.  The problem revolves around prematurely ending transitions initiated by `useTransition` within a `startTransition` callback.  This behavior differs from React 18, potentially causing unexpected component updates and rendering inconsistencies.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a simple example of using `useTransition`.  Under certain conditions, ending the transition prematurely leads to an incomplete update. This behavior may manifest as visual glitches or data inconsistencies.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution demonstrating how to properly handle transition termination in React 19's concurrent mode. This often involves ensuring all necessary updates are completed before signaling the transition's end.
